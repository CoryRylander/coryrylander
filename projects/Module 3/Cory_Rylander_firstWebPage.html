        <p><i>This is a recipe for meatballs passed down to me from my grandfather. The recipe is fairly simple, but packs quite the flavorful punch.</i></p>
        <img src="images/meatballs.jpg" alt="Meatballs in Skillet" class="center" style="width: 474px;height: 709px;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one my grandfather created when he was younger and taught me how to make. The meatballs only use <br> four ingredients, but the sauce is a little more complex. It doesn't use specific amounts, and is mainly to taste.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Meatball Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2 Pounds Ground Chuck:</b> I prefer ground chuck to ground beef, due to the lower fat, as well as it holding shape better.</li>
            <li><b>1 or 2 Diced Medium yellow onions:</b> This is a personal preferance of how many you should use.</li>
            <li><b>Jalapeno Peppers:</b> These should be sliced, and include seeds and flesh. Again, how many you should use is preferance.</li>
            <li><b>Salt and Pepper:</b> 1 tsp each.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>The sauce uses a combination of off-the-shelf sauces, and have no set amounts. They should be mixed to preferred taste.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A1 Sauce:</b> I prefer A1, but any of the steak sauces like it are usable.</li>
            <li><b>Heinz 57 Sauce:</b> Same as A1.</li>
            <li><b>Worcestershire Sauce:</b></li>
            <li><b>BBQ Sauce:</b> Whichever brand you prefer, but I like a combination of sweet and spicy.</li>
            <li><b>Ketchup</b></li>
            <li><b>Mustard</b></li>
            <li><b>Hot Sauce</b></li>
            <li>(optional)<b>Beer:</b> This is optional, but preferred. The alcohol will mostly cook off. 1 8oz can will suffice. Choose whichever <br> brand you prefer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cooking Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the sauce:</b> In a large bowl, stir together all the sauces until fully combined. Cover and set aside.</li>
            <li><b>Form the meatballs:</b> Combine the salt and pepper to the ground chuck, then form them into, roughly, 1-1.5oz meatballs. 
                <br> Using a feed scale helps, but isn't necessary. Place the meatballs in the skillet. Try to leave a little space between them.</li>
            <li><b>Add the Onions and Jalapenos:</b> Add the diced onions and sliced jalapenos to the peatballs in the skillet. Be sure to 
                <br> spread them out so the cover the meatballs and get between them.</li>
            <li><b>Cook:</b> Cover the skillet and cook the meatballs on medium heat, until fully brown on ouside. This usually takes between 
                <br> 10-15 minutes. After the meatballs brown, lower heat to medium-low and cook until an instant-read thermometer reads 160<span>&#176;</span>F.
                <br> Drain as much fat as you can from the meatballs when done. </li>
            <li><b>Add the sauce:</b> Add the sauce to the meatballs, making sure to cover all of them. Cover and bring the meatballs 
                <br> to a simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>(Optional)<b>Add the Beer:</b> Add the beer to the meatballs, and simmer an additional 5-10 minutes.This depends on how much 
                <br> alcohol flavor you prefer.</li>
            <li><b>Serve:</b> Serve with whatever sides you prefer.</li>
        </ol>
